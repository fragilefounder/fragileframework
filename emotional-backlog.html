      <h2>Shiny Demo, Hollow Soul</h2>
      <p><strong>Dear frAGILE,</strong><br>
      I just did a demo where I pretended we had progress.  
      The backend isn‚Äôt built. The design‚Äôs not approved.  
      But I smiled and clicked through Figma like it was live.  
      I hate how good I am at this.</p>

      <p><strong>Dear Shiny,</strong><br>
      What you pulled off was impressive. And yes ‚Äî emotionally exhausting.  
      You're not faking success. You're faking stability, because the team needs hope. That‚Äôs not deception. That‚Äôs survival.<br><br>
      But remember: you deserve to be proud of <em>real</em> progress too.  
      Build something small. Ship something honest. Even if it‚Äôs just a truth bomb in the next standup.<br><br>
      You‚Äôre not a fraud. You‚Äôre frAGILE.  
      And you‚Äôre not alone.

      <h2>Alignment Fatigue</h2>
      <p><strong>Dear frAGILE,</strong><br>
      I‚Äôve been in back-to-back alignment meetings for three weeks.  
      We‚Äôre aligning on alignment. The work isn‚Äôt moving.  
      I don‚Äôt even know what we‚Äôre building anymore.</p>

      <p><strong>Dear Fatigued,</strong><br>
      You are experiencing a sacred ritual we call ‚ÄúAlignment Spiral.‚Äù  
      It‚Äôs what happens when fear of misstep outweighs trust in progress.<br><br>
      Break the loop. Propose a prototype. Ship a stub. Start somewhere, and let the next step reveal itself.<br><br>
      Alignment is important. But motion is how we find direction.<br><br>
      May your next meeting be short and slightly useful.

      <h2>Backlog Guilt</h2>
      <p><strong>Dear frAGILE,</strong><br>
      My backlog is a landfill. I can‚Äôt look at it.  
      Grooming just means moving trash from one pile to another.  
      I feel like I‚Äôm failing my team.</p>

      <p><strong>Dear Guilty,</strong><br>
      Backlogs are not sacred scrolls. They‚Äôre compost piles.  
      And your job is not to polish every ticket ‚Äî it‚Äôs to fertilize the few that matter.<br><br>
      Archive the noise. Highlight the signal.  
      Your team needs a compass, not a hoarder.<br><br>
      You‚Äôre not failing. You‚Äôre learning to let go.
