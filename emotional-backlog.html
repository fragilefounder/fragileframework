      <h2>Shiny Demo, Hollow Soul</h2>
      <p><strong>Dear frAGILE,</strong><br>
      I just did a demo where I pretended we had progress. The backend isn’t built. The design’s not approved. But I smiled and clicked through Figma like it was live. I hate how good I am at this.</p>
      <p><strong>Dear Shiny,</strong><br>
      What you pulled off was impressive. And yes — emotionally exhausting. You're not faking success. You're faking stability, because the team needs hope. That’s not deception. That’s survival.<br><br>
      But remember: you deserve to be proud of <em>real</em> progress too. Build something small. Ship something honest. Even if it’s just a truth bomb in the next standup.<br><br>
      You’re not a fraud. You’re frAGILE. And you’re not alone.

      <h2>Alignment Fatigue</h2>
      <p><strong>Dear frAGILE,</strong><br>
      I’ve been in back-to-back alignment meetings for three weeks. We’re aligning on alignment. The work isn’t moving. I don’t even know what we’re building anymore.</p>
      <p><strong>Dear Fatigued,</strong><br>
      You are experiencing a sacred ritual we call “Alignment Spiral.” It’s what happens when fear of misstep outweighs trust in progress.<br><br>
      Break the loop. Propose a prototype. Ship a stub. Start somewhere, and let the next step reveal itself.<br><br>
      Alignment is important. But motion is how we find direction.<br><br>
      May your next meeting be short and slightly useful.

      <h2>Backlog Guilt</h2>
      <p><strong>Dear frAGILE,</strong><br>
      My backlog is a landfill. I can’t look at it. Grooming just means moving trash from one pile to another. I feel like I’m failing my team.</p>
      <p><strong>Dear Guilty,</strong><br>
      Backlogs are not sacred scrolls. They’re compost piles. And your job is not to polish every ticket — it’s to fertilize the few that matter.<br><br>
      Archive the noise. Highlight the signal. Your team needs a compass, not a hoarder.<br><br>
      You’re not failing. You’re learning to let go.
