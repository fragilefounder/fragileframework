      <h2>1. Ceremonial Rituals</h2>
      <p><strong>Sprint Planning:</strong> Fill Jira with vague hopes and duplicate epics → Start with outcomes, not tickets</p>
      <p><strong>Daily Standup:</strong> “Yesterday I… Today I… No blockers…” *[crickets]* → Ask: “What would unblock the team today?”</p>
      <p><strong>Retro:</strong> Air complaints, take no action → Turn 1 vent into 1 action item every sprint</p>
      <p><strong>Demo:</strong> Demo half-done work, panic when Zoom screen won’t share → Let teams show real value, not PowerPoint pixels</p>
    </section>

      <h2>2. Roles & Personas</h2>
      <p><strong>Product Owner:</strong> “Voice of the customer” → Forgets to talk to customers</p>
      <p><strong>Scrum Grandmaster:</strong> Keeps rituals alive → Can’t explain <em>why</em> we do them</p>
      <p><strong>Delivery Lead:</strong> Gets things shipped → Measures success only by shipping</p>
      <p><strong>Stakeholder X:</strong> Holds the purse strings → Joins sprint 6, changes sprint 1</p>
    </section>

      <h2>3. Tools & Templates We Pretend to Love</h2>
      <p><strong>The “Definition of Done” Poster:</strong> Hasn’t been updated since pre-pandemic. Still laminated.</p>
      <p><strong>Burndown Chart:</strong> Exists. Ignored. Only reviewed when things go wrong.</p>
      <p><strong>Velocity Metrics:</strong> Used to compare team happiness. Incorrectly.</p>
      <p><strong>The “Agile Board”:</strong> 78% of tickets live in “In Progress” or “Blocked” Purgatory.</p>

      <h2>4. Real Advice Hidden in the Chaos</h2>
      <p><strong>Jira isn’t the source of truth. People are.</strong> If the board doesn’t reflect reality, talk to the humans.</p>
      <p><strong>Velocity is not a performance metric.</strong> It's a planning signal — not a scoreboard.</p>
      <p><strong>You don’t need more process. You need more courage.</strong> Courage to speak clearly, say no, and show up human.</p>
      <p><strong>If you’re never laughing, you’re not doing it right.</strong> Satire is a signal — it means we care enough to notice.</p>
