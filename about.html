      <h2>👋 Who I Am</h2>
      <p>I’m <strong>Thach Nguyen</strong> — Director of Product Management by day, and creator of <em>frAGILE Framework™</em> by late-night, slightly sarcastic, caffeine-fueled sessions.</p>
      <p>I’ve led product teams across startups and Fortune 500s in the title, lending, and real estate tech industries. Today, I support an amazing team of wickedly smart product minds. We are building a modern title production platform. We are also building strong, clear systems that will thrive with or without me.</p>

      <h2>🎯 Why frAGILE?</h2>
      <p>frAGILE started as a joke. Like most good jokes, it came from truth. I’ve sat through retros that resolved nothing, roadmaps that solved everything (on paper), and daily standups that stood for absolutely no progress.</p>
      
      <p>I built frAGILE to expose the chaos, celebrate the survivors, and offer a little clarity in the form of satire. Because sometimes the best way to move forward... is to laugh, reset, and keep going.</p>

      <h2>🛠️ Tools I Actually Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>GitHub, Netlify, HTML/CSS — for building this site from scratch</li>
        <li>Azure DevOps, Jira — for managing real backlogs (with real blockers)</li>
        <li>Coaching frameworks — for mentoring PMs with empathy and edge</li>
        <li>Humor — because it's how teams stay human while shipping hard things</li>
      </ul>
