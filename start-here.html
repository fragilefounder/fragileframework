  <h1>🌀 Start Here</h1>
  <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">What even is frAGILE?</h2>

  <p>frAGILE is a parody framework for product teams who have seen things.</p>
  <p>It’s for anyone who’s sat through a four-hour retro that produced one sticky note and a migraine. For those who watched “Agile” get implemented like a corporate trust fall and hit the floor. And for the folks trying to do real work between the alignment meetings about alignment meetings.</p>

  <div class="quote">“We’re not even agile.”</div>

  <p>If you’ve ever typed that into Slack mid-sprint, you’re in the right place.</p>

  <h2>🤔 Is this serious?</h2>
  <p>Sort of. Not really. Maybe a little.</p>
  <p>frAGILE is satire. But it’s satire with insight. We laugh because it’s true. And because if we didn’t laugh, we’d probably cry.</p>
  <p>Everything here is exaggerated. But behind the jokes are real patterns, real frustrations, and sometimes real tips. This is for product people who want to feel seen, reflect on the chaos, and maybe even do something better next time.</p>

  <h2>👀 What you’ll find here</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="manifesto.html">The frAGILE Manifesto</a> — a reimagined set of values for the modern chaotic team.</li>
    <li><a href="playbook.html">The frAGILE Playbook</a> — ceremonies, rituals, and roles no team should use but probably already does.</li>
    <li>Articles, downloads, and tools — coming soon. Some helpful, some fake, some both.</li>
    <li>Merch — because sometimes you need to wear your dysfunction with pride.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>👤 Who made this?</h2>
  <p>Hi. I’m Thach. Product leader by day. Framework saboteur by night.</p>
  <p>My name has evolved over time to be pronounced as “tac". Both Hs are silent, kind of like those backlog items no one wants to own. 
  Or as famous philosopher lil' Wayne wrote: "Real G's move in silence like Lasagna,"</p>
  <p>I made frAGILE as a passion project, a creative outlet, and a way to call out what so many of us pretend is normal in product life. I built this site using GitHub, Netlify, DNS settings I barely understood, and a long-running list of inside jokes.</p>
  <p>You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nguyenthach" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> if you want to connect, collaborate, or commiserate.</p>

  <h2>🧨 Join the Cult (kindly)</h2>
  <p>If this made you laugh or nod too hard, you’re not alone.</p>
  <p>Drop your email below and I’ll send you frAGILE updates, new content, and maybe some stickers. No spam. Just vibes.</p>
<form name="pledge-loyalty" method="POST" action="/thanks_pledge.html" data-netlify="true" netlify-honeypot="bot-field">

  <p hidden><label>Don’t fill this out: <input name="bot-field" /></label></p>

  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your name (real or cult-given)" required>
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email address for future prophecies" required>

</form>

      <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #666; margin-top: 1rem;">
        This form might work… unless it’s feeling frAGILE today.
