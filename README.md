# frAGILE Framework™

Welcome to **frAGILE** — the parody Agile framework for teams who pivot so hard they end up where they started.

This site is a satirical look at product and Agile dysfunction, built for product managers, engineers, designers, and anyone who’s ever shouted “we’re not even agile” during a retro.

## 🔍 What You'll Find

- `index.html` — Main homepage for the frAGILE Framework
- `start-here-with-home.html` — New entry page to orient new visitors to what frAGILE is, why it exists, and how to explore
- `frAGILE_Manifesto_Enhanced_Full.pdf` — The frAGILE Manifesto, parodying Agile values with real insights
- `frAGILE_Playbook.pdf` — Ceremonies, fake roles, and rituals from the frAGILE "framework"
- Additional PDF and visual tools coming soon

## 💡 Why frAGILE?

This is a passion project created by **Thach Nguyen** to blend product leadership, humor, brand building, and creative storytelling. It exists to make product folks laugh, reflect, and maybe fix one thing.

## 🧭 How to Use

- Upload HTML files to Netlify or GitHub Pages
- Link `start-here-with-home.html` in your site’s nav as the new “Start Here” page
- Share content with your network — especially anyone running Agile ceremonies with more vibes than value
