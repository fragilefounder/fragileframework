# frAGILE Framework™

> Because if you can't scale chaos, is it even Agile?

Welcome to the official repo of the **frAGILE Framework** — the world's first parody framework that turns emotional blockers into business outcomes, vague standups into strategic rituals, and product roadmaps into PowerPoint-heavy spiritual journeys.

## 🤡 What Is frAGILE?

frAGILE is a **SaaStire-based framework** designed for teams who:
- Love ceremony but hate delivery
- Believe Jira is a feelings journal
- Confuse alignment with slides
- Treat MVP as “Make Vaporware Public”

## 📦 What's in This Repo?

- `index.html` – The glorious parody landing page  
- `/images/` – Avatars of your Founders in full alignment
